# ðŸ§  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) - Beginner Friendly

This repository contains a **clear and detailed implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm** for classification, explained step-by-step for beginners.

---

## ðŸ“Œ What is KNN?
KNN is a **supervised machine learning algorithm** used for classification and regression tasks.  
It works by **finding the 'K' closest data points** (neighbors) to a given point and predicting its output based on the majority vote (classification) or average (regression).
